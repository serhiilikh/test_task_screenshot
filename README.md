## Installation
1. `git clone`
2. Install Chrome 
3. Get Chromedriver (usually the latest one) https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and put into the project directory
4. Install requirements
5. Run bot.py
## Note
Bot is not ready for production use because is lacking any webhooks etc. This is intentional
because further configuration depends on the type of the prod server (e.g. Heroku vs other).
